# SPECIAL NOTE:
# Stick to a PORT value and keep it constant throughout
# the installation steps. (make sure it doesn't collide with
# already running service on the same port.
# Take port based on the ones allowed under SELinux Policy
# to http. Check with following command:
# $ sudo semanage port -l | grep http

# Recommended: Take PORT as 8000
# this port should be same as one configured for the shim
